### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
hi, i'm [Abhishek Naidu](https://abhishknads.me/), a passionate self-taught full stack web developer and a freelance software engineer from india. my passion for software lies with dreaming up ideas and making them come true with elegant interfaces. i take great care in the experience, architecture, and code quality of the things I build.

i am also an open-source enthusiast and maintainer. i learned a lot from the open-source community and i love how collaboration and knowledge sharing happened through open-source.
